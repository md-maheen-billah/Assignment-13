# Assignment-6

Today, I undertook assignment-6 provided by "Programming Hero" and effectively finished it, including the bonus section. The assignment required fundamental JavaScript, Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation and loading data using API. Also implemented search functionality for searching post categpoy, deployed a conditional button for the search functionality and showing/hiding loading spinner while loading api data.
